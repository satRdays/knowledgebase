satRdays was originally founded after requesting support the [R Consortium](//www.r-consortium.org).

## R Consortium proposal
Steph Locke and Gergely Daroczig were the key signatories to a [proposal for funding](//github.com/satRdays/RSaturday-proposal/blob/master/out/satRdays-proposal.pdf) where the events were initially outlined. We received US$10,000 of funding for the events.

## Events so far
We kicked off satRdays with the aim of running three events initially. Only two of those occurred:

- #1 [Budapest](//budapest.satrdays.org)
- #2 [Cape Town](//capetown2017.satrdays.org)
